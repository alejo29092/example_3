# Customer Data Cleanup and Analysis Challenge

## Background:
A company has provided you with a dataset containing customer information. The dataset is messy and contains inconsistencies and missing values. The company is looking for a junior data analyst to clean up the data, create a suitable data model, store the cleaned data, and perform basic analytics to derive insights.

## Challenge Description:

### Step 1: Data Cleansing
The dataset provided contains the following columns:

    CustomerID (unique identifier for each customer)
    FirstName
    LastName
    Email
    PhoneNumber
    Age
    Gender
    Address
    PurchaseAmount

Your task is to perform the following data cleansing operations:

    Remove duplicate records based on CustomerID.
    Remove rows where any essential column (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, PhoneNumber) is missing.
    Clean the Email column to ensure all emails are in a valid format.
    Handle missing and outlier values in the Age and PurchaseAmount columns appropriately (e.g., replace missing ages with the median, remove outliers in PurchaseAmount).
    Standardize the Gender column to have consistent values (e.g., 'Male', 'Female', 'Other').

### Step 2: Data Modeling
Create a suitable data model to represent the cleaned customer data. Define the schema and relationships between different entities.

###Â Step 3: Data Storage
Store the cleaned and modeled data into a SQL database of your choice. Design an appropriate database schema to store customer information efficiently.

### Step 4: Data Analytics
Perform the following analytics tasks on the cleaned data:

    Calculate the average age of customers.
    Find the top 5 customers with the highest purchase amounts.
    Analyze the distribution of genders among the customers.
    Calculate the total purchase amount for each gender category.

## Deliverables:

    Python or SQL code for data cleansing, modeling, storage, and analytics.
    Explanation of the data model and schema design.
    Results of the analytics tasks.
    A brief report summarizing your findings and any insights derived from the analysis.

## Evaluation Criteria:

    Correctness and completeness of the data cleansing process.
    Appropriateness of the data model and database schema design.
    Proper storage of cleaned data in the SQL database.
    Accuracy and relevance of the analytics results.
    Quality and clarity of the code and explanations provided.

**Note:**
Feel free to use any programming languages, libraries, or tools you are comfortable with. The challenge is designed to assess your data cleansing, modeling, storage, and basic analytics skills.
